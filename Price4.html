      <div id="para5">The A5 is overall a good car for its current pricing. It is a luxury vehicle so it is more pricy than most other vehicles. The price has however dropped in 2019 to about $20,000 from what it once was in 2016. The interior design is good and it offers a lot of comfort and utility. It is not the best car for turning and long distance but it is enough for most people to get by in.</div>
